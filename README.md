# ⚡ MCU Particle Visualizer ⚡

A particle-based visualization project inspired by iconic Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) characters. 

This project recreates character symbolism using procedural generation, geometry, and structured randomness instead of static images or 3D models.

## Inspiration

The concept was inspired by a similar visualization project based on the popular anime series *Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK)*. The idea of building recognizable forms entirely from particles served as the creative foundation for this project.

## Development Note

The implementation and refinement of geometric logic were developed with assistance from Google Gemini.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/Lasyavi-28/MCU-project-.git

2. Open the project folder.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
