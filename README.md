# ⚡ MCU Particle Visualizer ⚡

A particle-based visualization project inspired by iconic Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) characters. 

This project recreates character symbolism using procedural generation, geometry, and structured randomness instead of static images or 3D models.

## ✋ Gesture Controls

- 🖐 All fingers up → Thor (Mjolnir Lightning Mode)
- ✌️ Index + Middle up → Iron Man (Arc Reactor)
- ☝️ Only Index up → Loki (Magic Sphere)
- 🤏 Pinch (Thumb + Index) → Thanos (Infinity Stones)
- ✊ Fist → Captain America (Shield Mode)
- 🖕 Middle finger only → Deadpool (Chaos Mode)


## Inspiration

The concept was inspired by a similar visualization project based on the popular anime series *Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK)*. The idea of building recognizable forms entirely from particles served as the creative foundation for this project.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Real-time Hand Gesture Detection using MediaPipe

- ⚡ Cinematic Bloom Effects (UnrealBloomPass)
- 🛡️ Captain America Shield (Rotating Rings + Solid Star Geometry)
- ⚡ Thor Lightning Mode (Energy Burst Animation)
- 🟢 Loki Magic Sphere (Floating Rotational Effect)
- 💎 Thanos Infinity Stones (Color-Specific Particle Clusters)
- 🔵 Iron Man Arc Reactor (Triangular Core Geometry)
- 🔴 Deadpool Mode (Dynamic Eye Geometry + Chaos Spin)

## Development Note

The implementation and refinement of geometric logic were developed with assistance from Google Gemini.
